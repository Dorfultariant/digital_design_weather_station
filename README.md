## Course Project

We created a simple weather station with arduino uno and used light, temperature and air quality sensors. In this simple form, all the data is shown realtime by the state LEDs. 

A more user-friendly version could be implemented with LCD that would actually show the actual values and perhaps a way to store the data for later use.
